[![]({{BASE_PATH}}/images/812379349637ac925f2367420ca7d1031db8ddf8.jpg "OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA")](http://www.thedotmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Car278.jpg)As many of you may know, our good friend Christina recently had some issues with her car being under water (literally) during the Fort Lauderdale floods last month.

She had some money saved up, about $400, and it was stolen from her by a newcomer (For those not in recovery, that's a person who is currently new to the program, trying to get clean) who she let stay in her house.

I made this event to see if anyone is willing to donate any money to help Christina get back on her feet. I'm going to give $20 myself. You can either make a donation with paypal or talk to me about it.

Please, if you can spare at least $5, $10, or $20 -- it will all add up. Christina got fucked by the insurance company and could use our help.
