## Relationships require a lot of work

*   1-on–1 relationships are the most valuable
*   Link building is hard

## What do you want out of a relationship?

*   Value
*   Loyalty
*   Care
*   Friendships

## Stuff not to do

*   Don’t just ask for links. It’s creepy.
*   don’t lie to people

## Blogger outreach

*   Guest blogging

    *   Searching for sources the old way

            *   google the topic

        *   Who are the people behind the website?

            *   you are building relationships with people, not the website
        *   learn about the people

        *   New way to find sources

            *   go on linkedin and search
        *   search for employees from a company
        *   search twitter
        *   Follerwonk, SEO as a pro
        *   FIND PEOPLE FIRST
        *   Pinterest to find people and content that’s being shared
        *   Other money keywords

                    *   blogger
            *   blog owner
            *   marketer
            *   etc

                *   work with what you have

                    *   analyze who follows you (follerwonk)

                            *   analyze THEIR followers
                *   look for writers
                *   they are already engaged with you

                        *   do this with your competitors

                *   Don’t forget about the mass media

*   How do I contact people?

    *   Do your homework, find out about these people
    *   find the common denominator
    *   interact with them, like, tweet, +1
    *   don’t creep people out
    *   on twitter instead of
