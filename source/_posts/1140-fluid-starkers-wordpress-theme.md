<h2 class="warning">UPDATE: This is very, VERY old. Check out [Hoverboard](https://github.com/copterlabs/hoverboard). This starter theme based on Bootstrap is something I've been working on for a couple of years with [Jason Lengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf) and it's pretty fantastic. Please ignore what's written below.</h2>

I'm a huge fan of Elliot Jay Stocks' [Starkers Wordpress Theme](http://starkerstheme.com/), and an even bigger fan of the [1140 CSS Grid](http://cssgrid.net/), the absolutely fantastical fluid down to mobile grid framework. Today I needed them to marry and have a child, and this is what came of it:

I'm not really providing any documentation because both are pretty well documented. Derived from Elliot Jay Stocksâ€™ Starkers Theme ([http://starkerstheme.com/](http://starkerstheme.com/)) and the 1140 CSS Grid ([http://cssgrid.net/](http://cssgrid.net/)).
