I'm sitting around waiting for my car to get checked out. Since I'm waiting for a slow PayPal withdrawal to arrive in my bank account, I hope that this doesn't become horrifically expensive.

My car sounds like it needs a new engine, a new interior, exterior, body style, tires, and wheels. And stereo. I want a Camaro.

My current car is a light blue Toyota Camry; the most beautiful of all the Toyotas. It is epic and wonderful, a masterpiece of a car.

See how cool that car is? It actually looks really cool in this picture, in reality it looks like it belongs to a retired Florida octogenarian.
