I was browsing through Dribbble and I wanted to navigate through shots, like you can navigate through photos on Flickr.

Download The Script: [dribbble_keystroke_navig.user](http://www.thedotmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dribbble_keystroke_navig.user_.zip)

So I wrote this script. First install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/), restart Firefox, and then [drag this script](http://www.thedotmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dribbble_keystroke_navig.user_.zip) into the browser window.

When you're browsing shots, you can hit the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to scroll through the shots.

Happy Dribbbling and Merry HanuChristmaFestivukuh from [@thedotmack](http://twitter.com/thedotmack)!!

_Known Issue: When in an input or textarea, using the left and right arrows changes the page... I will be fixing this in a day or so, so I'm just letting ya'll know that v1.0 will be coming soon :)_
