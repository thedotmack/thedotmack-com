## SEO is Simple

*   3 Elements of SEO

        1.  Technical

            *   Can the page you want to rank be found in google?
        *   Does it load quickly?

        2.  Content

            *   Does your page title contain your keyword?
        *   are there 250 words about the keyword?
        *   are there pictures?

        3.  Links

            *   Are there links going to your page?
        *   The page with the most, best links wins!
*   Remember, google ranks web pages, not web sites.

    *   the page on your site ranks for your keyword, not your whole site

## Link building =

*   Find target site
*   Build links.

## 7 Principles of white hat link building

1.  In a world without google

    *   If google did not exist, where would you want to put your links? (No bizarre oddball directories and bs social bookmarking)
    *   <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">If Matt Cutts (Head of web spam team on google) was over my shoulder, whould I pursue getting this link?</span>

    *   Guarantees you won’t take hits from algorithm change

2.  Relevancy First!

    *   White hat link building follows relevancy, not pagerank
    *   Getting a link from a high PR page used to always be valuable, today its more the relevance of the content
    *   Relevancy Tree (create with team)

            *   write down all the terms that relate to your market
        *   circle all the words that have a group, community, or content based around it
        *   organize from most related to least related

3.  Website owners are people. And people link to people.

    *   the best links come from people
    *   if its an instant link, its probably not good
    *   call them if possible

4.  The most powerful link building tool is your brain

    *   No link buidling tool, seminar or article can come up with the ideas
    *   Use your brain!

5.  Link building is a team sport

    *   Link building alone is torturous, impossible, dreadful, terrible, ineffective.

6.  Forget viral

    *   If it goes viral, it goes viral.

7.  FTBOM: For the betterment of mankind.

    *   talk about something that’s for the betterment of mankind
    *   if you say “we have an awesome site” would you give the link? or if it were an article that adds value for the readers of the target site, you have a better chance of getting the link.

## Regarding anchor text

*   the clickable text on the page
*   the word is the link
*   Exact anchor text with your keyword is DANGEROUS

    *   If the objective of google is to find naturally occuring greatness, they don’t all have the same link names.

*   VARY YOUR ANCHOR TEXT (Link profile), also use your plain old URL.

## What’s new in link building for 2013

*   The legacy of spam is disappearing

    *   getting more calls from people who understand the value of quality links over quantity
    *   Used to talk about 1000’s of links, now people talk about 10’s of links
    *   Pages can rank with highly competitive links with less than 15 good quality links
    *   Spam will ultimately destroy long term success

*   Marketing = SEO

    *   think about places that you should get links in a world without google
    *   relevancy is just the beginning
    *   think about where and how to get your message out

*   Warning: Don’t underestimate link building.
