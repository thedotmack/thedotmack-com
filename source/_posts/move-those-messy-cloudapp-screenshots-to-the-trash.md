I use [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com/). I take a lot of screenshots. My mac desktop becomes a terrible, terrible mess.

What to do?

1.  Install this folder action I made with Automator. [http://dotma.cc/9FOH](http://dotma.cc/9FOH)
2.  ????????????????????
3.  PROFIT!
Thanks for your downloads and &lt;3
