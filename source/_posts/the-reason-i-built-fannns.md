I built a website called http://fannns.com where anyone and everyone can comment on shots from the website, Dribbble. The reason I did this is because I believe that there are opinions, suggestions, and feedback from people outside the Dribbble community that are valid and important.

I was drafted to Dribbble a few months ago and since then I haven't really been able to get the kind of quality feedback I'm looking for on my designs, because its near impossible to get followers on Dribbble if you're not one of the "design elite." I wanted to be a part of the community so badly so I could improve my design skills and be the best I can be at what I do. So far this is not the case.

Fannns will hopefully change this. It probably ruffled a few feathers over in Dribbble-land and that's why I haven't gotten much play on it yet.

What do you think?
